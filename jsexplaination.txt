Goal: Play The Rock Paper scissors Game 5 Times. 
      Display the Winner after Each game. 
      After 5 Games, Display the Total Score. 

// Logic: 

1. Declare `2` Global Variable's for keeping the score of player and computer.
2. Call The Function playRound() to play the game. 
3. Function playRound():
        1. Calls a Function to get the user's choice.
        2. If the user input is wrong, it Calls the playRound() Function again.
        3. Then it call's another function to get the computer choice.
        4. Then it declare's a local Variable and call the function to decide the winner and pass the
           user and computer choice.
        5. The `decide` the winner function will return who won the game or it's a tie.
        6. Then the 1st if statement check's if it's tie and if it's a tie, it will again call the 
           playRound() and it'll play the game again. 
        7. Then the second statement checks if the decideTheWinner function returned computer as the winner
           and if it's, it will Display the winner for that game and update the computer score counter of the global variabel.
        8. The 3rd if statement check's if the human is winner and it will display the result and update 
           the global variable of the human score counter.

4. Function getComputerChoice():
        1. we declare a variabel and call random() method and multiply it 
           by 3 to get the number choice between 0 and 2 and we round the 
           values using floor() method.
             if 0: Rock
             if 1: Paper
             if 2: scissors
5. Function getHumanChoice():
        1. Prompt user input.
        2. Change The user input to lowercase.
        3. if rock:return it.
           if paper: return it.
           if scissors: return it.
           if not: return error.

6. decideTheWinner(a, b):
        1. computer and human choices get's passed as an argument.
        2. if : tie
             return: tie
            if human:rock
              if computer scissors
                  return: human won
              else: return computer won

            if human:paper
              if computer rock
                  return: human won
              else: return computer won

            if human:scissors
              if computer paper
                  return: human won
              else: return computer won

// To display the final winner
1. if human and computer score is 5:
       if computer is greater than human score
                display the computer as winner with score count.
        else
                 display the player as winner with score count.

Le's run the program and see how it works: 
1. playRound() get's called.
2. User input's rock.
3. computer input's scissors.
4. decide the winner return's human.
5. if statement inside the playRound() update's the score counter and display the winner.
6. Global variabel get's updated.
7. If played 5 times, it display the total Score.
